# Pandemic Model
Pandemic Model project for CSCI0390: Spatial Agent-Based Modeling at Middlebury College

A simulation of the spread of COVID on a college campus. The model uses Middlebury College's previously implemented COVID guidelines to simulate the effect of various safety and prevention guidelines. 

## Description
The model simulates using the selected conditions until it reaches the threshold of a COVID outbreak, defined by >75% of the student body becoming infected. As long as the percent of infected students remains below the given threshold, the model will continue to simulate. To the right of the model window, plots and monitors are provided to monitor the model in real-time.
